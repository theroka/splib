# splib
Fetch and write Sharepoint list data.

**Disclaimer**: Originally a module in a non-public project, this lib is used in production, although it is poorly documented.

Tested with Microsoft Sharepoint 2010.

## Setup

To install dependencies and transpile with Babel
```
npm install
or
yarn install
```

To transpile sources separately
```
npm run-scripts postinstall
or
yarn postinstall
```
Transpiled will be written to dist/.

To generate source docs with Typedoc
```
node_modules/.bin/typedoc
or
yarn typedoc
```
